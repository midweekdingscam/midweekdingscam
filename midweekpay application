Payday loan reforms ensure availability of credit

By adopting balanced reforms, Colorado, Hawaii, Ohio, and Virginia have lowered the cost of small credit, provided essential consumer protections, and preserved loan availability. For instance, after Colorado changed its law in 2010 to allow borrowers to repay in installments over time and at costs and interest rates that are about three times lower than before the reform, loan sizes remained largely unchanged, total days of credit issued did not drop, the number of borrowers declined by less than 10%, and loans continued to reach roughly the same population of borrowers.6

Similarly, Ohio passed bipartisan legislation that established clear rules and a level playing field for lenders. And by early 2022, the state had licensed nearly 120 locations to offer small loans. Several of these lenders are new to Ohio and had avoided operating in the state before the reforms because of a lack of regulatory clarity and an oversaturation of high-cost lenders. The total number of stores in Ohio declined after reform, which was expected. But the remaining stores became much more efficient, serving an average of 1,266 unique customers annually, compared with the national average of just 500. This increased efficiency enabled lenders to profitably offer loans at prices that are about four times lower than what they had previously charged, as required by the reform.
